# Remark

Remark reflows the text of your markdown files.

![reflow example][reflow-test]

[reflow-test]: ./remark_test.gif

## How it Works

Reflow automatically reflows the text to a defined maximum character
length when you save.

The default maximum character length is 72. If you would like to change
this number, go to `Atom` > `Preferences` > `packages` > `Remark` and
change it there.  

If you would like to manually run reflow, use the command `^` + `⌥` +
`O`.

## Installation

Run the following command:

```
apm install remark
```

You may need to restart Atom. Or you can reload the current window with
the command `^` + `⌥` + `⌘` + `L`.
