# Remark Examples

## Elements that Wrap

### Text

This should all be within the character maximum. This line was something
originally very, very long. It just kept going and test going and going
and going...

### List Items

1. This is a very, very, very long list item. It will automatically wrap
to the next line (without tabs).
  * Just a side note: you can always manually add the tabs that suit
your own style.
* List item wrapping also works with really, really long list items that
use `*`, `+`, or `-`.

## Elements that Don't Wrap

### Headers

#### Here is a very, very long header element, and it will not wrap. I promise it won't.
